### Hi there 👋

I'm Bernardo, an Android developer based in Portugal.

I've been working as an Android developer for a company in the automotive sector for the past 2.5 years.

I work mainly with Android and Kotlin.

I also want to learn a more low level language, hence why I've started learning Rust during my free time as well.

### Fun facts about me:
- I build custom gaming PCs on the side for friends and clients
- I like to watch anime, read manga, play videogames and also some sports such as football and padel
- Before working in software development, I worked as a construction worker
